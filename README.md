### URLhaus URL
The base URL to use for the URLhaus API

### Minimum URL Count
Minimum count of urls to be notified on from URLhaus

### Domain and IP Blacklist

This is an alternate option that can be used to specify domains or IPs that you do not want sent to URLHaus.  The data must specify the entire IP or domain to be blocked (e.g., www.google.com is treated differently than google.com).

### Ignored Domain Regex

This option allows you to specify a regex to set domains.  Any domain matching the regex will not be looked up.

### Ignored IP Regex

This option allows you to specify a regex to set IPv4 Addresses.  Any IPv4 matching the regex will not be looked up.

## Installation Instructions

Installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).
